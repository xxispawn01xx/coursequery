# Sidebar and Tabs Loading Fix

## Problem Resolution

When you rename folders inside course directories, the sidebar may fail to load because:
1. Course indexes still reference old folder names
2. AI dependencies error blocks interface loading
3. Session state gets corrupted with invalid course data

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Interface Loading Priority
- Sidebar loads first before any AI model checks
- Tabs display even if model loading fails
- Model failures show warnings but don't stop interface

### 2. Course Rename Detection
- Automatic detection of renamed courses in sidebar
- Smart similarity matching between old and new names
- One-click fix buttons to update indexes

### 3. Emergency Reset Button
- "🚨 Fix Sidebar Loading" button clears course cache
- Force refresh of course detection
- Clears corrupted session state

### 4. Syntax Warning Fixed
- Fixed escape sequence warning in logger message
- Changed `H:\` to `H:` to avoid syntax errors

## How to Use the Fixes

### If Sidebar Won't Load:
1. Look for "🚨 Fix Sidebar Loading" button in sidebar
2. Click it to clear cache and refresh
3. Sidebar should reload with current course structure

### If You Renamed Course Folders:
1. Look for "🔄 Fix Renamed Courses" section in sidebar
2. See suggestions for old → new course name mappings
3. Click "✅ Update" to preserve embeddings and fix index
4. Click "🗑️ Clean" to remove orphaned indexes

### If Still Having Issues:
1. Restart the Streamlit app completely
2. Check that your H:\ directory paths are correct
3. Use the "🔄 Refresh Course List" button

## Technical Details
