 needs natural language text in the prompt.

What you do instead:

Search your vector DB using your user’s question (convert question to embedding).

Retrieve the top 3–5 most relevant text chunks.

Construct a prompt like:

swift
Copy
Edit
"Here are some lecture notes:\n
[Transcript chunk 1]\n
[Transcript chunk 2]\n
[Transcript chunk 3]\n
Based on this, answer the question: '[user's question]'"
Send this prompt to OpenAI via API.

This is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It keeps prompts small, fast, and cost-effective.

🔌 Should You Connect via Python API?
Yes — this is the most practical and scalable approach.

Python tools like:

LangChain

LlamaIndex

or your own script using openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)

Can manage:

Vector search (retrieve relevant content),

Prompt formatting,

API call to OpenAI (GPT-3.5/GPT-4),

And return answer to Streamlit or CLI.

🔁 Optional Enhancements
Course structure awareness: Include metadata per chunk (e.g., course name, lecture title) so the answer can say “From Course X, Lecture Y…”

Auto-indexing: When you add a new transcript, auto-process, chunk, and embed it.

Per-user session memory (in Streamlit): Store history in st.session_state and keep recent Q&A context if needed.

🔒 Cost + Privacy Tips
Local Whisper + OpenAI Embeddings: Low cost, but embedding ~1 GB of text will still cost a few dollars once (not per-query).

Use GPT-3.5 for most Q&A, GPT-4 for deep ones. You can add a “toggle” for model selection.

Token efficiency: Limit to top 3–5 chunks per question (keeps prompt <4K tokens, saves money).
