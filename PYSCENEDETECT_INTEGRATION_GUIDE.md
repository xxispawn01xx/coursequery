# PySceneDetect Integration Guide

## Overview

The course management system has been upgraded with professional PySceneDetect algorithms for superior scene detection accuracy in educational video content. This replaces the basic OpenCV histogram comparison with industry-standard scene detection methods.

## Architecture Upgrade

### Before: Basic OpenCV Detection
- Simple histogram comparison between frames
- Single threshold-based detection
- Limited accuracy for educational content
- Basic screenshot capture

### After: Professional PySceneDetect Integration
- **ContentDetector**: HSL color space analysis for slide changes
- **AdaptiveDetector**: Handles camera movement and lighting variations
- **ThresholdDetector**: Fast processing for simple content
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation to OpenCV when unavailable

## Detection Algorithms

### 1. ContentDetector (Recommended for Educational Content)
- **Technology**: HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color space analysis
- **Best For**: Slide-based presentations, course materials, educational videos
- **Accuracy**: Superior detection of content changes vs basic histogram methods
- **Threshold Range**: 10.0 - 50.0 (default: 30.0)
- **Performance**: Moderate speed, highest accuracy

### 2. AdaptiveDetector (Best for Live Recordings)
- **Technology**: Adaptive threshold based on recent frame history
- **Best For**: Lecture recordings, camera movement, lighting changes
- **Accuracy**: Excellent for challenging conditions
- **Threshold Range**: 10.0 - 40.0 (default: 25.0)
- **Performance**: Slower processing, robust detection

### 3. ThresholdDetector (Fastest Processing)
- **Technology**: Simple frame difference analysis
- **Best For**: Fast-paced content, quick processing needs
- **Accuracy**: Basic but reliable
- **Threshold Range**: 5.0 - 20.0 (default: 12.0)
- **Performance**: Fastest processing, good for large video collections

## Content Type Optimization

### Educational (Recommended Settings)
- **Algorithm**: ContentDetector
- **Threshold**: 30.0
- **Description**: Optimized for slide-based content with clear scene changes
- **Use Case**: Course videos, presentations, tutorial slides

### Lecture (Live Recording Settings)
- **Algorithm**: AdaptiveDetector
- **Threshold**: 25.0
- **Description**: Handles camera movement and lighting changes
- **Use Case**: Classroom recordings, webinars, live presentations

### Demonstration (Code/Software)
- **Algorithm**: ContentDetector
- **Threshold**: 35.0
- **Description**: Higher threshold for subtle content changes
- **Use Case**: Software tutorials, coding demonstrations, screen recordings

### Fast-Paced (Quick Processing)
- **Algorithm**: ThresholdDetector
- **Threshold**: 15.0
- **Description**: Quick detection for rapidly changing content
- **Use Case**: Fast-moving content, large video batches

## Performance Optimization

### Processing Speed Options
1. **Full Quality (1x)**: No downscaling, maximum accuracy
2. **2x Faster**: Half resolution processing, good balance
3. **4x Faster**: Quarter resolution, fastest processing

### Memory Management
- Automatic model unloading between videos
- GPU memory optimization for RTX 3060
- Efficient frame processing with configurable downscaling

## Installation and Setup

### Optional Enhancement (PySceneDetect)
PySceneDetect is an **optional** enhancement for professional-grade scene detection:

```bash
# Optional: Install PySceneDetect for enhanced accuracy
pip install scenedetect[opencv]

# Alternative: Basic PySceneDetect
pip install scenedetect
```

**Important**: This is an offline-first application. PySceneDetect provides superior accuracy but is not required.

### Offline-First Design
- **Default**: Basic OpenCV detection works 100% offline
- **Enhanced**: PySceneDetect provides professional algorithms when available
- **Automatic Fallback**: System gracefully degrades when PySceneDetect unavailable
- **Clear Feedback**: User interface shows which detection engine is active

## Usage in Course Processing

### Enhanced Scene Detection Interface
1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose detection method based on content type
2. **Content Optimization**: Select video type for automatic parameter tuning
3. **Performance Tuning**: Configure speed vs accuracy trade-offs
4. **Vision Integration**: Optional OpenAI Vision analysis of screenshots

### Results Format
```json
{
  "course_name": "Course Name",
  "detection_method": "content",
  "threshold": 30.0,
  "total_videos": 5,
  "total_scenes": 127,
  "total_screenshots": 89,
  "processing_date": "2025-07-30T...",
  "videos": {

      "scenes_count": 25,
      "processing_status": "completed",
      "scenes": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### File Outputs
- **Screenshots**: High-quality JPEG files in `{video_name}_scenes/` directory
- **Results File**: `pyscenedetect_analysis.json` with comprehensive analysis
- **VTT Integration**: Screenshots can be combined with transcription data

## Integration with Multimodal Processing

### Vector Embeddings
- Scene screenshots analyzed with OpenAI Vision
- Content descriptions added to vector embeddings
- Searchable visual content combined with text documents
- Enhanced course query capabilities

### Workflow Integration
1. **Bulk Transcription**: RTX 3060 Whisper processing
2. **Scene Detection**: PySceneDetect analysis with screenshots
3. **Vision Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4o content description
4. **Vector Processing**: Unified embeddings from all content types

## Technical Benefits

### Accuracy Improvements
- **HSL Color Space**: More accurate than RGB histogram comparison
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Handles lighting variations automatically
- **Educational Optimization**: Specialized algorithms for course content
- **False Positive Reduction**: Intelligent filtering of noise transitions

### Performance Benefits
