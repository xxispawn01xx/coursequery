# Replit + VSCode Integration Workflow

## Complete Course-to-Development Pipeline

This guide integrates Replit and VSCode into your course learning workflow, creating a seamless transition from course content to deployable applications.

## The Complete Workflow

```
Course Processing → Knowledge Extraction → Project Generation → Replit Deployment → VSCode Development
```

## Phase 1: Enhanced Project Generation

### Generate Replit-Ready Projects
When querying your course assistant, use this enhanced template:

```
"Based on this [course topic] course, create a complete [project type] with the following specifications:

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
- [Your specific requirements]

REPLIT INTEGRATION:
- Generate complete .replit configuration file
- Include replit.nix for dependencies
- Create replit-compatible file structure
- Add README with one-click Replit setup
- Include environment variable templates
- Configure proper run commands for Replit

VSCODE INTEGRATION:  
- Include .vscode/ workspace configuration
- Add tasks.json for build/run tasks
- Include launch.json for debugging
- Add extensions.json for recommended extensions
- Configure proper Python/Node.js paths
- Include settings.json for code formatting

DEPLOYMENT READY:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker configuration for portability
- Environment configuration templates
- Production deployment scripts"
```

## Phase 2: Automated Replit Project Creation

### Method 1: GitHub-Replit Integration (Recommended)

**Step 1: Generate Project Structure**
Your course assistant creates the complete project with:
```
/project-name/
├── .replit              # Replit configuration
├── replit.nix          # Dependencies for Replit
├── .vscode/            # VSCode workspace config
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── tasks.json
│   ├── launch.json
│   └── extensions.json
├── src/                # Your application code
├── tests/              # Test files
├── README.md           # Setup instructions
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

**Step 2: Automated GitHub Push**
Add this shell script to your workflow:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto-deploy.sh
PROJECT_NAME=$1
cd generated-projects/$PROJECT_NAME

# Initialize git and push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project from course: $COURSE_NAME"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/$PROJECT_NAME.git
git push -u origin main

echo "Project ready at: https://github.com/yourusername/$PROJECT_NAME"
echo "Import to Replit: https://replit.com/github/yourusername/$PROJECT_NAME"
```

**Step 3: One-Click Replit Import**
- Navigate to generated GitHub repo
- Click "Import to Replit" button
- Project automatically configured and ready to run

### Method 2: Direct File Generation for Replit

**Enhanced Query for Direct Replit Setup:**
```
"Generate this project with complete Replit configuration:

1. Create .replit file with proper run command
2. Include replit.nix with all necessary packages
3. Add environment variable placeholders
4. Configure database connections for Replit
5. Include deployment instructions for Replit
6. Add collaboration setup for team development"
```

## Phase 3: VSCode Integration

### Automatic VSCode Workspace Setup

**Generated .vscode/settings.json:**
```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "./venv/bin/python",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/__pycache__": true,
        "**/.pytest_cache": true
    }
}
```

**Generated .vscode/tasks.json:**
```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run Development Server",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["app.py"],
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "echo": true,
                "reveal": "always",
                "focus": false,
                "panel": "shared"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Generated .vscode/launch.json:**
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: FastAPI",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "app.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {
                "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Phase 4: Shell Integration Scripts

### Course-to-Replit Automation

**Create automated deployment script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# course-to-replit.sh

COURSE_NAME=$1
PROJECT_TYPE=$2
DESCRIPTION=$3

echo "Processing course: $COURSE_NAME"
echo "Generating $PROJECT_TYPE project..."

# Query your course assistant system
python -c "
import requests
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/generate-project', {
    'course': '$COURSE_NAME',
    'project_type': '$PROJECT_TYPE', 
    'description': '$DESCRIPTION',
    'include_replit': True,
    'include_vscode': True
})
print(response.json()['project_path'])
"

# Auto-deploy to GitHub
PROJECT_PATH=$(python get_project_path.py)
cd $PROJECT_PATH

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Generated from course: $COURSE_NAME"
git push origin main

echo "Ready for Replit import: https://replit.com/github/yourusername/$(basename $PROJECT_PATH)"
echo "Ready for VSCode: code $PROJECT_PATH"
```

## Phase 5: Enhanced Course Queries

### Replit-Specific Project Generation

**Web Application with Replit Deployment:**
```
"Create a complete web application based on this course with:
- FastAPI backend configured for Replit hosting
- React frontend with Replit-compatible build process
- PostgreSQL database with Replit DB integration
- Automatic environment variable setup for Replit
- GitHub Actions that deploy to Replit
- VSCode debugging configuration for local development
- Documentation for switching between Replit and local development"
```

**Data Science Project with Replit Collaboration:**
```
"Build a complete data science project optimized for Replit collaboration:
- Jupyter notebooks that work in Replit
- Data pipeline that runs in Replit environment
- Streamlit dashboard for Replit hosting
- Shared environment configuration for team collaboration
- VSCode extensions for data science workflow
- Documentation for seamless Replit-to-local switching"
```

## Phase 6: Development Workflow Integration

### Seamless Environment Switching

**Replit Development:**
- Use for rapid prototyping and collaboration
- Share live development with teammates
- Quick deployment and testing
- Browser-based development

**VSCode Development:**
- Use for complex debugging and refactoring
- Advanced Git integration
- Full IDE capabilities
- Local performance optimization

### Project Handoff Scripts

**Replit-to-VSCode:**
```bash
# Clone from Replit, setup for VSCode
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
code .
```

**VSCode-to-Replit:**
```bash
# Push changes, update Replit
git add .
git commit -m "Local development updates"
git push origin main
# Replit automatically pulls changes
```
