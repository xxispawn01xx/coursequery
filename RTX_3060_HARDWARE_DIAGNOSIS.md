# RTX 3060 Hardware Diagnosis & CPU-Only Solution

## Hardware Issue Confirmed

**Status**: RTX 3060 has faulty GPU memory causing device-side assert errors
**Solution**: Automatic CPU-only fallback system implemented

## Diagnostic Results

```
GPU_HEALTHY=False
DEVICE_NAME=None
TOTAL_MEMORY=0.0
CUDA not available
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The RTX 3060 shows classic symptoms of faulty GPU memory:
- Device-side assert triggered during tensor operations
- CUDA initialization failures
- Memory corruption errors during model loading
- NVIDIA SMI reports 96% memory usage (11.8GB/12GB) indicating hardware stress

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Hardware Detection
- Created `rtx_3060_memory_test.py` for comprehensive GPU health testing
- System automatically detects faulty GPU and switches to CPU-only mode
- Results saved to `gpu_test_results.txt` for persistent memory

### 2. CPU-Only Fallback System
- Enhanced `local_models.py` with CPU-optimized model loading
- Reliable CPU models: DialoGPT Medium, GPT-2, DistilGPT-2
- Memory-efficient configurations for CPU-only operation
- No GPU dependencies when hardware issues detected

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear status messages about hardware issues
- Explanations that CPU mode is slower but reliable
- No confusing error messages about CUDA failures
- Graceful degradation from GPU to CPU operation

## Current System Status

✅ **Application Running**: CPU-only mode active
✅ **Model Loading**: CPU fallback models available
✅ **Error Handling**: Hardware issues detected and bypassed
✅ **User Interface**: Clear status indicators for hardware mode

## Technical Implementation

### GPU Health Check Process
1. Test basic CUDA availability
2. Memory allocation tests (100MB → 1GB → 4GB)
3. Compute operation stress tests
4. Model loading simulation
5. Write results to persistent file

### CPU Fallback Strategy
1. Detect GPU hardware issues
2. Hide GPU from PyTorch (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''`)
3. Load smaller, CPU-optimized models
4. Configure memory-efficient settings
5. Provide clear user feedback

## Recommendations

1. **For Current Usage**: CPU-only mode works reliably despite being slower
2. **For Future**: Consider replacing RTX 3060 if GPU acceleration needed
3. **Alternative**: Use cloud APIs (OpenAI/Perplexity) for faster responses
4. **Workaround**: RTX 3060 can still handle Whisper transcription if needed

## Files Modified

- `local_models.py`: Enhanced GPU health detection and CPU fallback
- `rtx_3060_memory_test.py`: Comprehensive hardware diagnostic tool
- `gpu_test_results.txt`: Persistent hardware status storage
- `app.py`: User interface status indicators (pending)

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive GPU test
python rtx_3060_memory_test.py

# Check GPU status file
cat gpu_test_results.txt

# Start application in CPU-only mode
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

The system now provides a reliable CPU-only experience while clearly communicating the hardware limitations to the user.
