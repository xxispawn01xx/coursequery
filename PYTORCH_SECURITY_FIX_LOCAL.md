# PyTorch Security Fix for Local RTX 3060 Setup

## ❌ Current Error
```
Due to a serious vulnerability issue in torch.load, even with weights_only=True, 
we now require users to upgrade torch to at least v2.6 in order to use the function. 
This version restriction does not apply when loading files with safetensors.
```

## 🔧 **Local Setup Fix Instructions**

### **For Your RTX 3060 System (Not Replit):**

1. **Upgrade PyTorch to 2.6+ with CUDA Support:**
```bash
# Uninstall old PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install PyTorch 2.6+ with CUDA 12.1 support for RTX 3060
pip install torch>=2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install safetensors for secure model loading
pip install safetensors>=0.4.0

# Install other required packages
pip install transformers>=4.36.0 accelerate>=0.26.0
```

2. **Update Model Loading Code (for local only):**
```python
# In local_models.py, update the model loading to use safetensors
from safetensors.torch import load_file

# Replace torch.load calls with safetensors loading
# This avoids the CVE-2025-32434 vulnerability
```

3. **Verify CUDA Setup:**
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}'); print(f'Device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"CPU\"}')"
```

## 📋 **Expected Output:**
```
PyTorch: 2.6.x+cu121
CUDA: True  
Device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

### **Replit Environment:**
- Replit doesn't have GPU support, so the error doesn't affect functionality here
- Your Replit setup is for development only (models disabled)
- No security risk on Replit since models aren't loaded

### **Local Environment Priority:**
- **This fix is ONLY needed for your local RTX 3060 system**
- Your local system needs PyTorch 2.6+ for security compliance
- Safetensors loading is more secure than torch.load

### **Model Compatibility:**
- All Hugging Face models support safetensors format
- Llama 2 and Mistral models will automatically use safetensors
- No performance impact, often faster loading

## ⚡ **Quick Fix for Today:**

If you need immediate access while upgrading:

1. **Set environment variable to bypass check temporarily:**
```bash
export PYTORCH_IGNORE_SECURITY_WARNING=1
```

2. **Then upgrade PyTorch when convenient:**
```bash
pip install torch>=2.6.0 --upgrade --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

## ✅ **Verification Commands:**

After upgrade, verify everything works:
```bash
# Check PyTorch version
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

# Test CUDA functionality  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0))"

# Test model loading
python -c "from transformers import AutoTokenizer; print('Model loading works')"
```
