# Local Optimization Guide for RTX 3060 12GB

## Current Status: ✅ CUDA Working!

Your system is now properly configured with CUDA support:
- GPU: RTX 3060 with 12GB VRAM
- PyTorch: CUDA-enabled
- Models: 4-bit quantization for efficiency

## Normal Behavior (Don't Worry About These)

### Checkpoint Loading on Startup
```
Loading checkpoint shards: 0%|...| 0/2 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
```
**This is normal!** Models are cached but still need to load into GPU memory each startup.

### Expected Startup Time
- **First run**: 3-5 minutes (model download)
- **Subsequent runs**: 30-60 seconds (loading cached models)
- **With your RTX 3060**: Much faster than CPU-only systems

## Performance Monitoring

### GPU Memory Usage (Typical)
- Mistral 7B (4-bit): ~4GB VRAM
- Llama 2 7B (4-bit): ~4GB VRAM  
- Embeddings: ~1GB VRAM
- **Total**: ~9GB used, 3GB free

### Response Times (Expected)
- **Document upload**: 10-30 seconds
- **Query processing**: 2-5 seconds
- **Response generation**: 1-3 seconds

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Keep Models Loaded
- Don't restart the app unnecessarily
- Once loaded, keep it running for fast responses

### 2. Batch Processing
- Upload multiple documents at once
- Process several queries in one session

### 3. Monitor GPU Temperature
- Use MSI Afterburner or GPU-Z
- RTX 3060 should stay under 80°C

### 4. Windows Power Settings
- Set to "High Performance" mode
- Disable Windows GPU scheduling if issues occur

## Troubleshooting

### If Responses Are Slow
1. Check GPU usage in Task Manager
2. Ensure no other GPU-intensive apps running
3. Verify CUDA version matches PyTorch

### If Out of Memory Errors
1. Reduce max_results in queries (use 1-3 instead of 10)
2. Close other applications
3. Restart the application to clear GPU cache

### If Models Won't Load
1. Check internet connection (first download only)
2. Verify HuggingFace token is valid
3. Clear cache and redownload if corrupted

## File Locations

- **Models**: `C:\Users\AliDesktop\Desktop\CoursQueryRemote\coursequery\models\`
- **Courses**: `C:\Users\AliDesktop\Desktop\CoursQueryRemote\coursequery\indexed_courses\`
- **Raw Docs**: `C:\Users\AliDesktop\Desktop\CoursQueryRemote\coursequery\raw_docs\`

Your RTX 3060 setup is working perfectly! The checkpoint loading is normal behavior.
