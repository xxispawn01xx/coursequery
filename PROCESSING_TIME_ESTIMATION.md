# PySceneDetect Processing Time Estimation
## 157 Video Apache Airflow Course

**Current Environment**: Replit Development (CPU-only)  
**Target Environment**: Local RTX 3060 System  
**Videos to Process**: 157 educational videos

---

## Time Estimation Analysis

### Current Replit Environment (Development)
**Hardware Limitations:**
- CPU-only processing (no GPU acceleration)
- Limited computational resources
- Network-based file system

**Estimated Processing Time:**
- **Per Video**: 2-5 minutes (depending on length and complexity)
- **157 Videos**: 5-13 hours total processing time
- **Status**: Likely very slow, may appear frozen

### Target RTX 3060 Environment (Production)
**Hardware Advantages:**
- CUDA acceleration for PySceneDetect
- Local file system access
- 12GB VRAM for efficient processing

**Estimated Processing Time:**
- **Per Video**: 15-30 seconds (3-5x real-time)
- **157 Videos**: 40-80 minutes total processing time
- **Status**: Smooth, efficient processing

## Processing Speed Breakdown

### Video Processing Factors

| Factor | Replit Impact | RTX 3060 Impact |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Resolution** | 1920x1080 = slower CPU processing | GPU handles efficiently |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS = more frames to analyze | CUDA parallel processing |
| **Algorithm** | ContentDetector CPU-intensive | GPU-accelerated analysis |
| **Batch Size** | Memory constraints limit batching | Efficient batch processing |

### Realistic Time Estimates

| Video Length | Replit (CPU) | RTX 3060 (GPU) | Improvement |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **5 minutes** | 3-8 minutes | 15-25 seconds | 7-19x faster |
| **15 minutes** | 8-20 minutes | 30-60 seconds | 8-20x faster |
| **30 minutes** | 15-40 minutes | 60-120 seconds | 12-20x faster |
| **60 minutes** | 30-80 minutes | 120-300 seconds | 10-15x faster |

### How to Monitor Progress
1. **Check Log Updates**: Look for new video processing messages
2. **CPU Usage**: Monitor if CPU is actively working
3. **File Creation**: Check for new screenshot directories being created
4. **Memory Usage**: Ensure system isn't running out of memory

## Recommendations

### For Current Replit Processing
1. **Be Patient**: CPU processing is significantly slower
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for progress indicators
3. **Check Memory**: Ensure system doesn't run out of RAM
4. **Consider Subset**: Test with smaller batch first

### For RTX 3060 Production
1. **Optimal Settings**: Use ContentDetector with threshold 30.0
2. **Batch Processing**: Process 10-20 videos at a time
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Track GPU memory usage
4. **Quality Settings**: Balance speed vs accuracy needs

## Performance Optimization

### Replit Optimization (Current)
```python
# Reduce processing load
detection_settings = {
    'downscale_factor': 4,  # Process at 1/4 resolution
    'max_screenshots': 20,  # Limit screenshot extraction
    'min_scene_length': 5.0  # Longer minimum scenes
}
```

### RTX 3060 Optimization (Target)
```python
# Maximize quality and speed
detection_settings = {
    'downscale_factor': 1,  # Full resolution
    'max_screenshots': 50,  # More screenshots
    'min_scene_length': 2.0  # Shorter minimum scenes
}
```

## Progress Monitoring Commands

### Check Processing Status
```bash
# Monitor CPU usage
top -p $(pgrep python)

# Check for new files
find archived_courses -name "*scenes*" -newer /tmp/start_time

# Monitor log output
tail -f /var/log/processing.log
```

### Estimated Completion Times

| Environment | Conservative Estimate | Optimistic Estimate |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Replit (Current)** | 8-13 hours | 5-8 hours |
| **RTX 3060 (Target)** | 60-90 minutes | 40-60 minutes |

---

## Conclusion

**Current Situation**: Processing 157 videos on Replit will take **5-13 hours** due to CPU-only processing limitations.

**Recommendation**: For production use, deploy on local RTX 3060 system where the same processing would complete in **40-90 minutes** with superior quality.

**Status Check**: The system is likely working but appears slow due to hardware constraints. Monitor logs for progress updates and consider processing a smaller subset for initial validation.
