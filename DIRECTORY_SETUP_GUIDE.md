# Directory Setup Guide

## Setting Your Course Directory Path

Since web browsers don't allow folder selection, you need to manually enter your course directory path.

### Step 1: Find Your Course Directory Path

1. **Windows Explorer**: Navigate to your course folder
2. **Click the address bar** (shows the path)
3. **Copy the full path** (e.g., `H:\Archive Classes\coursequery\archived_courses`)

### Step 2: Enter Path in App

1. Open the sidebar in the app
2. Look for "📁 Course Directory" section
3. Click "📝 Set Custom Directory Path" to expand
4. Paste your path in the text field
5. Click "📂 Update Directory Path"

### Example Paths

**Your Local System:**
```
H:\Archive Classes\coursequery\archived_courses
```

**Common Windows Paths:**
```
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Courses
D:\MBA_Materials\Courses
E:\Education\University_Courses
```

**Mac/Linux Paths:**
```
/Users/yourname/Documents/Courses
/home/yourname/courses
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Path not found**: Make sure the directory actually exists
- **Permission error**: Ensure the app has access to read that directory
- **Special characters**: Avoid spaces in folder names if possible
- **Network drives**: Local drives work better than network locations

The app will automatically detect all course subdirectories once the correct path is set.
