# PyTorch Security Fix for Offline Usage

## âœ… Fix for CVE-2025-32434 Error

The error you're seeing is a security protection in newer PyTorch versions. Here's how to fix it for your offline RTX 3060 system:

## **Local Installation Fix (Do this on your RTX 3060 system):**

```bash
# 1. Upgrade PyTorch to 2.6+ with CUDA support
pip install torch>=2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# 2. Install safetensors for secure model loading
pip install safetensors>=0.4.0

# 3. Upgrade transformers to use safetensors by default
pip install transformers>=4.36.0 --upgrade
```

## **Alternative: Force Safetensors Usage**

Add this to your local_models.py (for local use only):

```python
# Force safetensors usage for security
os.environ['HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER'] = '1'

# In model loading, add:
model_kwargs = {
    "cache_dir": str(self.config.models_dir),
    "trust_remote_code": True,
    "use_safetensors": True,  # Force safetensors
    "torch_dtype": torch.float16,
}
```

## **Development Environment (Replit)**

On Replit, the app runs in development mode with models disabled, so this error shouldn't affect your workflow here. The security fix is only needed for your local RTX 3060 system.

## **Why This Happened**

- PyTorch 2.6+ blocks unsafe model loading for security
- HuggingFace models need to use safetensors format
- Your local system needs the upgraded PyTorch version
- Replit environment uses CPU-only PyTorch which has different requirements

## **Status**

- âœ… Replit: Development-only, models disabled
- ðŸ”§ Local: Needs PyTorch 2.6+ upgrade for security
- ðŸ“Š Cost analysis: Ready and working regardless of PyTorch version
