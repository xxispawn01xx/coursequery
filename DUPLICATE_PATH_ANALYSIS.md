# Duplicate Path Analysis & Solution

## Issue Identified

Your Apache Airflow course has a **physical duplicate directory structure** on the H:\ drive:

```
H:\Archive Classes\coursequery\archived_courses\
└── [FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Apache Airflow The HandsOn Guide\
    └── [FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Apache Airflow The HandsOn Guide\  ← DUPLICATE!
        └── 2 - The basics of Apache Airflow\
            └── 11 - Practice Quick tour of Airflow UI.mp4
```

## Root Cause

This happens when:
1. Course extraction creates a folder with the course name
2. The extracted contents also have a root folder with the same name
3. Results in nested duplicate directory structure

## Solution Implemented

The transcription system now:

1. **Detects duplicate paths** in search results
2. **Attempts to find clean paths** without duplicates first
3. **Constructs corrected paths** by removing duplicate directories
4. **Validates existence** of cleaned paths before use
5. **Falls back gracefully** if cleaning doesn't work

## Manual Fix (Optional)

If you want to fix the directory structure permanently:

### Option 1: Move files up one level
```bash
# Navigate to the duplicate directory
cd "H:\Archive Classes\coursequery\archived_courses\[FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Apache Airflow The HandsOn Guide\"

# Move all contents from nested duplicate to parent
move "[FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Apache Airflow The HandsOn Guide\*" .

# Remove empty duplicate directory
rmdir "[FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Apache Airflow The HandsOn Guide"
```

### Option 2: Use the automated fix
The transcription system now handles this automatically, so no manual intervention needed.

## Verification

After the fix, paths should work like:
```
✅ BEFORE (with duplicates): 
H:\...\[Course Name]\[Course Name]\video.mp4

✅ AFTER (cleaned):
H:\...\[Course Name]\video.mp4
```

## Log Messages to Watch For

- "Found clean file at: ..." (no duplicates found)
- "Successfully using cleaned path: ..." (duplicates removed)
- "Final cleanup successful: ..." (last-resort cleaning worked)

The system now handles all these cases automatically for successful RTX 3060 transcription.
