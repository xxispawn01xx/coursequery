# Real Estate AI Stack - Fully Local

## Overview

This is a comprehensive, privacy-focused real estate course analysis application that runs 100% offline using local AI models. The application processes various document formats (PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, EPUB, videos/audio) and provides an AI-powered Q&A interface for course materials without any external API calls, model downloads, or online dependencies.

## User Preferences

**CRITICAL**: Pure offline operation - NEVER build for Replit, always 100% offline-first architecture. All development is for local Windows system with H:\ drive access.
**NEVER store model files on Replit** - models exist only locally on user's RTX 3060 system.
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Model preference: Local RTX 3060 models with hybrid cloud API fallback for enhanced responses.
Creative tasks preference: Local Excel generation with Google Drive integration as optional enhancement.
Workflow: Pure offline development â†’ RTX 3060 local processing â†’ optional cloud API enhancement.
Deployment strategy: 100% offline capable, RTX 3060 for all AI processing, local file system for courses on H:\ drive.
Authentication: Local HuggingFace token storage, no external dependencies required.
**Architecture Focus**: Windows local development only - Replit is purely for development/testing, not deployment.

## Primary Use Cases

**eBook Library Management**: User has large collection of eBooks in single directory, needs focused processing by theme/topic rather than bulk processing all books together.
**Udemy Course Processing**: Complete course analysis including video transcription (RTX 3060), code files, and PDFs applied to specific problem sets.
**Multi-Page Strategic Planning**: Generate comprehensive business plans, implementation roadmaps, and strategic frameworks from book content using EPUB processing.
**Bulk Audio/Video Processing**: Process podcast series, lecture collections, and video courses with folder structure preservation for RTX 3060 transcription.

## How Course Indexing Works

When you "index a course," the system processes all documents in that course folder and creates searchable vector embeddings. Here's what actually happens:

### Document Processing
- **Multi-format Support**: PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, EPUB files are converted to text
- **Video/Audio Transcription**: Media files are transcribed using Whisper (locally on RTX 3060)
- **Content Chunking**: Large documents are split into manageable pieces for better search
- **Metadata Extraction**: File types, paths, and content statistics are preserved

### Vector Embeddings Generation
- **Per-Course Isolation**: Each course gets its own separate vector index
- **Local MiniLM Model**: Converts text chunks into numerical vectors for semantic search
- **Persistent Storage**: Embeddings are saved to disk for instant reuse
- **Syllabus Weighting**: Course syllabi get higher priority in search results

### Individual vs Combined Processing
- **Individual Courses**: Each course maintains separate embeddings for focused, specific answers
- **Combined Processing**: You could merge multiple courses, but this would dilute specificity
- **Best Practice**: Keep courses separate for precise, context-aware responses

### Perplexity Integration Workflow
1. **Local Processing**: Course documents â†’ vector embeddings (RTX 3060, offline)
2. **Query Matching**: Your question finds relevant course chunks via vector similarity (local)
3. **Context Assembly**: Most relevant chunks are gathered as focused context (local)
4. **Cloud API Call**: Only the focused context + question sent to Perplexity for intelligent response
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual queries, not document processing or embeddings
6. **Quality Control**: Generated content is vetted from all course materials for accuracy

### Answer Specificity
**More specific answers come from smaller, focused course collections** because:
- Less noise in the vector space
- More targeted content matching
- Higher relevance scores for course-specific topics
- Better context assembly for the AI model
