# Real Estate AI Stack - Fully Local

## Overview

This is a comprehensive, privacy-focused real estate course analysis application that runs 100% offline using local AI models. The application processes various document formats (PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, EPUB, videos/audio) and provides an AI-powered Q&A interface for course materials without any external API calls, model downloads, or online dependencies.

## User Preferences

**CRITICAL**: Pure offline operation - never build for Replit, always offline-first architecture. NEVER store model files on Replit - models exist only locally.
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Model preference: Local RTX 3060 models with hybrid cloud API fallback for enhanced responses.
Creative tasks preference: Local Excel generation with Google Drive integration as optional enhancement.
Workflow: Pure offline development → RTX 3060 local processing → optional cloud API enhancement.
Deployment strategy: 100% offline capable, RTX 3060 for all AI processing, local file system for courses.
Authentication: Local HuggingFace token storage, no external dependencies required.

## Primary Use Cases

**eBook Library Management**: User has large collection of eBooks in single directory, needs focused processing by theme/topic rather than bulk processing all books together.
**Udemy Course Processing**: Complete course analysis including video transcription (RTX 3060), code files, and PDFs applied to specific problem sets.
**Multi-Page Strategic Planning**: Generate comprehensive business plans, implementation roadmaps, and strategic frameworks from book content using EPUB processing.
**Bulk Audio/Video Processing**: Process podcast series, lecture collections, and video courses with folder structure preservation for RTX 3060 transcription.
