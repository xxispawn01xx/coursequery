# Models Directory

This directory is for local AI model storage only.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Models are NOT stored in Git/GitHub**

- Models download automatically when you run the app locally
- Models are gitignored to prevent huge files in your repository
- This keeps your GitHub sync fast and prevents timeouts

## Local Usage

When you run locally:
1. Models download automatically to this directory
2. Llama 2 7B (~4GB) and Mistral 7B (~4GB) 
3. Embedding models (~80MB)
4. Whisper models (~1.5GB)

## On Replit

- Models are disabled to save resources
- Only document processing works
- Use local development for full AI features

Total model size when fully loaded: ~10GB
